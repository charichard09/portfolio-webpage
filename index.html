    <p>
      <span class="drop-cap">H</span>ello! My name is Richard Cha. I have always been very passionate about anything computer and tech related. Whether 
      that be learning how to build my own PC's starting from my first one in ninth grade or in 2010 buying a Smart Pulse Pen 
      that could track and record my pen strokes on overpriced thick specialty made paper because having a digital record 
      of my notes sounded amazing (tablet stylus' existed but where expensive or clunky!). Unfortunately I never graduated 
      from college, and have since been working in the food service industry from bussing to cooking to serving. But don't 
      feel sorry for me, as you will see below I have always kept dabbling in tech, and am currently in a Coding Course 
      with Epicodus to finally reach the goal of taking my passion and turning it into a career!
